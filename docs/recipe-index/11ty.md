# 11ty

Drop-in recipe for indexing the 11ty base blog.

## Prerequisite

The [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator is very popular, and with good reason: it's relatively lightweight and simple, and can be very powerful.

Start with the [base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) to keep it simple.

## Folder Structure

The base blog has posts inside a `posts` folder, but other pages can be in any sub-folder. The generated output is in a `_site` folder, so that's also where we'll put the Hunch index file.

```
/hunch.config.js
/package.json
/about
	/index.md # this translates to `site.com/about`
/posts
	/firstpost.md # this translates to `site.com/posts/firstpost`
/_site
	/hunch.json
	# ...other generated files...
```

## Configuration

The default Hunch configuration is almost sufficient, but since content can be multiple root folders, we need to specify some filters:

```js
// hunch.config.js
export default {
	// The folder to scan is actually the root folder:
	input: './',
	// The index file will go with the 11ty generated files:
	output: './_site/hunch.json',
	// Property names of metadata to treat as "collections", like "tags" or "authors".
	aggregations: {
		// The main metadata in the 11ty base blog:
		tags: {
			title: 'Tags',
			conjunction: false,
		}
	},
	// The content and all aggregation fields will be searchable automatically, but
	// we need to specify additional searchable fields:
	searchableFields: [
		'title',
		'description',
	],
	// We also need to be explicit about what non-searchable, non-aggregated fields
	// to store with the index.
	storedFields: [
		'date',
	],
	// Since 11ty stores all content at the folder root, we need to filter files.
	preFilter: filepath => {
		const baseDir = filepath.split('/')[0]
		const EXCLUDED_DIRS = [
			'.github',
			'_site',
			'_data',
			'_includes',
			'css',
			'feed',
			'img',
			'node_modules',
		]
		return !EXCLUDED_DIRS.includes(baseDir)
	}
}
```

## Indexing

Add the Hunch indexing step as a post-build step to the base blog [package.json file](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/blob/main/package.json#L5):

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx @11ty/eleventy",
+   "postbuild": "hunch",
    "bench": "DEBUG=Eleventy:Benchmark* npx @11ty/eleventy",
```

Then, when you run `npm run build` to build the 11ty site, Hunch will run on completion and output `_site/hunch.json`.
